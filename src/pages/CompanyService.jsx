        A paragraph is defined as “a group of sentences or a single sentence that forms a unit” (Lunsford and Connors 116). 
        Length and appearance do not determine whether a section in a paper is a paragraph. 
        For instance, in some styles of writing, particularly journalistic styles, a paragraph can be just one sentence long.
